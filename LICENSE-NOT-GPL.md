While the public release of ADL is licensed under the GPLv3 copyleft license, we realize that this is not always a
viable option for products and projects. Therefore, ADL is also available under a less restrictive licensed tailored
to the customer's needs.

In short, the alternative license removes the copyleft source-sharing stipulations from the GPL license, its virality
clause, and grants the licensee a non-transferrable, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive license to use ADL in one product
or project. The complete license text is still being worked on, and will be available soon.

This license is, first and foremost, a commercial license. The payment model (buyout license, subscription model,
per-seat cost, per-product cost) is down to the customer's requirements and the nature of the product that ADL will be
incorporated into.

However, this does not exclude established open-source projects under less restrictive licenses from applying for a
custom license that allows ADL to be used, while maintaining their existing license independence. It may be difficult
for a project to attempt a relicensing under the GPL, and staying under the existing license may be preferable.
Therefore, we also offer free or discounted licenses to established open-source projects.
